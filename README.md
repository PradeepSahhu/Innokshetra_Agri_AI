# Innokshetra_Agri_AI

Final submission 

## What we did in brief

We want to migrate farmers from cash crops which often damage the environment and lead to ground water level reduction to environmentally sustainable crops, which are more profitable as well.

This migration has a huge knowledge gap and we want to bridge this knowledge gap using our IOT sensors and our ML models which will guide the farmers throughout their journey.
